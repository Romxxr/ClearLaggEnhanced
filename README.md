## ⚙️ Configuration

### Entity Clearing

Configure automatic entity clearing in `config.yml`:

```yaml
entity-clearing:
  enabled: true              # Enable/disable automatic clearing
  interval: 300              # Clear interval in seconds (300 = 5 minutes)
  protect-named-entities: true   # Protect entities with custom names
  protect-tamed-entities: true   # Protect tamed animals (pets)
  worlds: []                 # Target specific worlds (empty = all worlds)

  # Whitelist: Entities that will NEVER be cleared
  whitelist:
    - "VILLAGER"
    - "IRON_GOLEM"
    - "ARMOR_STAND"
    - "ITEM_FRAME"
    - "PAINTING"
    - "MINECART"
    - "BOAT"
```

**How it works:**
- Any entity **NOT** in the whitelist will be cleared (except players, named, and tamed)
- Players are always protected
- Named entities are protected when `protect-named-entities: true`
- Tamed animals are protected when `protect-tamed-entities: true`

**Common entity types:** `DROPPED_ITEM`, `EXPERIENCE_ORB`, `ARROW`, `ZOMBIE`, `SKELETON`, `CREEPER`, `SPIDER`, `ENDERMAN`, `COW`, `SHEEP`, `PIG`, `CHICKEN`, `PRIMED_TNT`

---

### Lag Prevention Modules

#### Mob Limiter
Prevents mob spawning when chunk limits are reached.

```yaml
mob-limiter:
  enabled: true
  max-mobs-per-chunk: 50    # Global mob limit per chunk

  # Per-type limits (optional)
  per-type-limits:
    enabled: true
    limits:
      ZOMBIE: 10
      SKELETON: 10
      CREEPER: 8
      VILLAGER: 15
      COW: 12
      CHICKEN: 15
```

**Features:**
- Global chunk limit prevents excessive mob spawning
- Per-type limits control specific mob types
- Automatic chunk optimization when limits are exceeded
- Compatible with spawner and natural spawns

---

#### Spawner Limiter
Controls mob spawner activation rates to reduce lag.

```yaml
spawner-limiter:
  enabled: true
  spawn-delay-multiplier: 1.5  # Multiply spawner delays by this value
  worlds: []                    # Target specific worlds (empty = all)
```

**How it works:**
- Increases spawner delays when chunk mob limits are reached
- Multiplies the current spawner delay by the configured multiplier
- Integrates with mob limiter for optimal results

---

#### Misc Entity Limiter
Manages non-mob entities like armor stands, boats, and item frames.

```yaml
misc-entity-limiter:
  enabled: true

  # Per-chunk entity limits (-1 = unlimited)
  limits-per-chunk:
    ARMOR_STAND: 5
    BOAT: 5
    CHEST_BOAT: 5
    MINECART: 5
    ITEM_FRAME: 5
    GLOW_ITEM_FRAME: 5
    PAINTING: 5

  # Protection settings
  protect:
    named: true              # Protect named entities
    tags:                    # Protect entities with these scoreboard tags
      - "CLE_PROTECTED"

  # Sweep configuration
  sweep:
    interval-ticks: 100      # How often to check chunks (100 = 5 seconds)
    max-chunks-per-tick: 20  # Chunks to process per tick (prevents lag spikes)

  # Admin notifications
  notify:
    admins-permission: "CLE.admin"
    throttle-seconds: 60     # Cooldown between notifications

  worlds: []                 # Target specific worlds (empty = all)
```

**Protecting entities:**
1. **By name** - Set `protect.named: true` to protect entities with custom names
2. **By tag** - Add scoreboard tags to protect specific entities:
   ```
   /tag @e[type=armor_stand,limit=1,sort=nearest] add CLE_PROTECTED
   ```

**How it works:**
- Periodically sweeps chunks to count miscellaneous entities
- Removes excess entities when limits are exceeded (oldest first)
- Respects protection settings (named/tagged entities)
- Notifies admins when entities are trimmed

---

### Notifications

Configure entity clearing warnings and notifications:

```yaml
notifications:
  broadcast-times: [60, 30, 10, 5]  # Warning times in seconds
  type: "ACTION_BAR"                # Display type: CHAT, ACTION_BAR, or TITLE
  console-notifications: false       # Show notifications in console

  sound:
    enabled: true
    name: "BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING"
    volume: 1.0
    pitch: 1.2
```

**Notification types:**
- `CHAT` - Send warnings in chat
- `ACTION_BAR` - Display above the hotbar (recommended)
- `TITLE` - Show as large title overlay

---

### Database

ClearLaggEnhanced uses a database for performance tracking and optimization.

```yaml
database:
  type: "sqlite"             # Database type: sqlite or mysql
  file: "clearlagg.db"       # SQLite database filename

  # MySQL configuration (only used if type is "mysql")
  mysql:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3306
    database: "clearlagg"
    username: "root"
    password: "password"
    ssl: false
```

**Database features:**
- **HikariCP Connection Pooling** - Enterprise-grade connection management
- **Strategic Indexes** - 10-100x faster queries
- **Automatic Migration** - Schema updates handled automatically
- **MySQL Support** - For multi-server networks

## 🎯 Performance Optimization Guide

### For Small Servers (1-20 players)
```yaml
entity-clearing:
  interval: 600              # 10 minutes

mob-limiter:
  max-mobs-per-chunk: 75
```

### For Medium Servers (20-100 players)
```yaml
entity-clearing:
  interval: 300              # 5 minutes

mob-limiter:
  max-mobs-per-chunk: 50
  per-type-limits:
    enabled: true
```

### For Large Servers (100+ players)
```yaml
entity-clearing:
  interval: 180              # 3 minutes

mob-limiter:
  max-mobs-per-chunk: 35
  per-type-limits:
    enabled: true

misc-entity-limiter:
  enabled: true
  limits-per-chunk:
    ARMOR_STAND: 3
    ITEM_FRAME: 3
```

### General Tips
1. **Start conservative** - Begin with default settings and adjust based on performance
2. **Monitor regularly** - Use `/lagg tps` and `/lagg chunkfinder` to identify issues
3. **Enable gradually** - Enable lag prevention modules one at a time
4. **World-specific config** - Configure different settings for different worlds
5. **Player education** - Inform players about entity limits and lag prevention

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Entities Not Being Cleared

**Check these settings:**
- Is the entity in the whitelist? Remove it if it should be cleared
- Is `protect-named-entities: true`? Named entities won't be cleared
- Is the entity tamed? Set `protect-tamed-entities: false` to clear tamed animals
- Is entity clearing enabled? Check `entity-clearing.enabled: true`

### Performance Still Poor

**Try these solutions:**
1. Enable more lag prevention modules
2. Lower mob limits per chunk (`max-mobs-per-chunk: 35`)
3. Reduce clearing interval (`interval: 180` = 3 minutes)
4. Use `/lagg chunkfinder` to locate problem areas
5. Enable misc entity limiter for armor stands/boats

### Commands Not Working

**Verify:**
- Player has the correct permission node
- Use full command `/lagg` instead of aliases
- Console can always execute commands regardless of permissions
- Check for permission plugin conflicts

### High Memory Usage

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce entity clearing interval
2. Clear more entity types (reduce whitelist)
3. Enable all lag prevention modules
4. Allocate more RAM to your server
5. Check for memory leaks in other plugins

### Folia Compatibility Issues

**Notes:**
- ClearLaggEnhanced is fully Folia-compatible
- Ensure you're running the latest version
- Report any Folia-specific issues on GitHub
